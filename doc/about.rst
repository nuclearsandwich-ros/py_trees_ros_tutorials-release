About
=====

This package is home to a series of tutorials that incrementally walk through the
development of a behaviour tree application layer for a robot using the
libraries and tools from the `py_trees`_ (:ref:`sphinx docs <py_trees:index-section>`)
and `py_trees_ros`_ (:ref:`sphinx docs <py_trees_ros:index-section>`)
packages.
